# Easy Pack Frontend :luggage: :memo:

EasyPack is a Flutter application designed to help users create customized packing lists for trips based on the weather conditions and temperatures. This repository contains the frontend code for the EasyPack app.

The app uses [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management to handle state updates and data flow throughout the application.

The server of EasyPack is maintained in a separate repository [easypack-server](https://github.com/yardensepton/easypack-server).
